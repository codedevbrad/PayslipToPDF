    <p> Making paysliips in word and converting to PDF to pay my employee was a hassle because i was manually having to mentally add and check that the weekly hours were correct + the total per month.. Now, with the system I quicky made, it's an easier way for me to generate monthly Payslips with the needed option of generating a PDF. </p>
